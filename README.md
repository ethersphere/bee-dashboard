## Install

Install globally with npm. We require Node.js's version of at least 12.x and npm v6.x (or yarn v2.x).

```sh
npm install -g @ethersphere/bee-dashboard
```

## Usage

:warning: To successfully connect to the Bee node, you will need to enable the Debug API and CORS. You can do so by setting `cors-allowed-origins: ['*']` and `debug-api-enable: true` in the Bee config file and then restart the Bee node. To see where the config file is, consult the [official Bee documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/working-with-bee/configuration#configuring-bee-installed-using-a-package-manager)
