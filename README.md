> An app which helps users to setup their Bee node and do actions like cash out cheques, upload and download files or
> manage your postage stamps.

**Warning: This project is in alpha state. There might (and most probably will) be changes in the future to its API and
working. Also, no guarantees can be made about its stability, efficiency, and security at this stage.**

This project is intended to be used with **Bee version <!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_START -->1.12.0-88c1d236<!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_END -->**.
Using it with older or newer Bee versions is not recommended and may not work. Stay up to date by joining the
[official Discord](https://discord.gg/GU22h2utj6) and by keeping an eye on the
[releases tab](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard/releases).

## Install

Install globally with npm. We require Node.js's version of at least 12.x and npm v6.x (or yarn v2.x).

```sh
npm install -g @ethersphere/bee-dashboard
```

## Usage

:warning: To successfully connect to the Bee node, you will need to enable the Debug API and CORS. You can do so by
setting `cors-allowed-origins: ['*']` and `debug-api-enable: true` in the Bee config file and then restart the Bee node.
To see where the config file is, consult the
[official Bee documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/working-with-bee/configuration#configuring-bee-installed-using-a-package-manager)

### Terminal

To start use:

```sh
bee-dashboard
```

This should open the webpage on [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You can also define your own port with the `PORT` environment variable. E.g.

```sh
export PORT=3005
bee-dashboard
```

Will start the bee-dashboard on [`http://localhost:3005`](http://localhost:3005)

### Docker

To build Docker image and run it, execute the following from inside project directory:

```sh
docker build . -t bee-dashboard
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 bee-dashboard
```

Bee dashboard is now available on [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

### Development

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethersphere/bee-dashboard.git

cd  bee-dashboard

npm i

npm start
```

The Bee Dashboard runs in development mode on [http://localhost:3031/](http://localhost:3031/)

#### Environmental variables

The CRA supports to specify "environmental variables" during build time which are then hardcoded into the served static files. 
We support following variables:

 - `REACT_APP_BEE_DESKTOP_ENABLED` (`boolean`) that toggles if the Dashboard is in Desktop mode or not.
 - `REACT_APP_BEE_DESKTOP_URL` (`string`) defines custom URL where the Desktop API is expected. By default, it is same origin under which the Dashboard is served.
 - `REACT_APP_BEE_HOST` (`string`) defines custom Bee API URL to be used as default one. By default, the `http://localhost:1633` is used.
 - `REACT_APP_BEE_DEBUG_HOST` (`string`) defines custom Bee Debug API URL to be used as default one. By default, the `http://localhost:1635` is used.
 - `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_RPC_URL` (`string`) defines the default RPC provider URL. Be aware, that his only configures the default value. The user can override this in Settings, which is then persisted in local store and has priority over the value set in this env. variable. By default `https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org` is used.

#### Swarm Desktop development

If you want to develop Bee Dashboard in the Swarm Desktop mode, then spin up `swarm-desktop` to the point where Desktop is initialized (eq. the splash screen disappear) and:

```sh
echo "REACT_APP_BEE_DESKTOP_URL=http://localhost:3054
REACT_APP_BEE_DESKTOP_ENABLED=true" > .env.development.local

npm start
npm run desktop # This will inject the API key to the Dashboard 
```
